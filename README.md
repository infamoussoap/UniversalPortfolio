# Convex optimization over a probability simplex
This repository contains the code for our paper [Convex optimization over a probability simplex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09046). It has usable code for <ins>Universal Portfolios</ins> and reproducible code for this paper section.

Our other [repository](https://github.com/infamoussoap/ConvexHull) contains the code for <ins>Projection onto a Convex Hull</ins>, <ins>Optimal Question Weighting</ins>, 

## Implemented Algorithms
For Universal Portfolios, we implement Cauchy-Simplex, Exponentiated Gradient Descent, Buy and Hold, and Newton-based Method by [Agarwal et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1143844.1143846).
